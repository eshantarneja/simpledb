Lab 2 Writeup
	The only major design decision occurred with our page eviction policy. For the policy, we chose to go simple. All that our evict page function does is choose the first page from the buffer pool and discard it. If there is an error in evicting it should throw an error. We expect to build upon it in further labs, but for right now this simple policy fit our needs. For the join, we maintained the nested-loop structure because it seemed the most clear to us.
	No major changes were made to the API. We added a few helper functions, the most notable being "EmptyPage(TransactionId tid)" in HeapFile. EmptyPage is used as a helper to insert tuple, finding a HeapPage with an open slot to add the given tuple to or returning null if there is no such page. There are no missing elements of our code.
	Unlike Lab1, this lab was not difficult for us in its scope, but more in terms of complexity. Understanding how all the iterators were connected in terms of "parents" and "children" gave us a lot of trouble. We also spent a good amount of our time debugging the Insert System Test and writing the Join test. All in all, this lab took us about 30 hours total.
